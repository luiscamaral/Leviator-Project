# What is the Leviator ?

The Leviator is a device made of two arrays of ultrasonic transducers, able to levitate and to control the movements of small objects such as styrofoam beads in 3 dimensions mid-air, using acoustic levitation. 

The levitation is possible thanks to standing wave created by the transducers of the device. Levitating objects are trapped in pressure nodes of those standing waves, surrounded by antinodes, which are going to apply forces on the object, making it levitate. The movements are made by modulating the phase of emission of the transducers. 

This project was awarded a first prize at the XXVth Olypimpiades de Physique, a national physics contest in France.

## How it works

The levitation is possible thanks to standing wave created by the transducers of the device. Levitating objects are trapped in pressure nodes of those standing waves, surrounded by antinodes, which are going to apply forces on the object, making it levitate. The movements are made by modulating the phase of emission of the transducers.

The actual maximum reliable movement speed is 10.5cm per second for 1 to 5 beads. 100% success rate movement speeds are 0.5cm to 1.5cm/s speeds and speeds from 4.1 to 5.4 cm per second. If more beads are put in a node, the success rate decreases. 


## Want to build a Leviator ?

The 3D parts are available on this page in the STL folder. Many electronic parts are also necessary (list to be provided soon).

Assemble all the parts (Full instructions should soon be available on Instructables). The Fritzing schematic is available in the SCHEMA folder. It will show you the electronic schematic of the Leviator device.

Run the python 'generateMegaCode16x16new.py' program. This will generate a 'moveArray16x16.io' file in the 'generated' folder. Compile using your Arduino IDE and flash on the Arduino MEGA card.


## Future improvements

We are planning to make a new Leviator, smaller and modular. 3D pieces of the protoype are available in the STL folder
We are now working on the miniaturization of the H-bridges, which will be probably done by making PCBs.
